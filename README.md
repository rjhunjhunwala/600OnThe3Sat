# 600OnThe3Sat
3Sat is an area of diligent and focused serious research: until now. 
The goal of this repo is to come up with novel bad ways to solve 3sat, and track the slowdown factor
and wrongness factor over exhaustive enumeration. Real SOTA methods (dedicated sat solver, branch and cut ILP)
methods will also be used as a second benchmark to show just how bad these methods are.
